# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
Amazon Vine Group provides a service allowing manufactures and publishers to receive reviews for their products.  Within this project there were 50 datasets to choose from AWS.  Our instructions were:
1) Select one of the datasets.
2) Extract data form the dataset, transform the data and load the transformed data to pgadmin.  allowing us to produce working data to display to the manufactures and publishers.
3) Data will provide information if there is bias toward favorable reviews from vine members.

## Results:

## Summary:

The Vine program percentage for the 5-star reviews are at 42% and the Non-vine program for the 5-star reviews are at 50%.  Based off of these percentages I believe there is no bias toward favorable reviews from the Vine members within this dataset.
